I fell myself very attentive to details and KISS-oriented developer, prefer simple tools and learn principles instead of frameworks.

My favourite client-side tool is AngularJS, previously had experience with jQuery, bootstrapJS, underscore e.t.c. For a long time i've practised the PSD to html & css markup (pixel perfect), freelance programming with JavaScript, developed Google Extensions.

During project developing my primary database is MSSQL, but i've supported a few projects with PostgreSQL. My favourite ORM is Dapper, previously had experience with LINQ to SQL, Entity Framework.

Depends on requirements, i create unit tests for critical code sections. As version control system i usually use git.
