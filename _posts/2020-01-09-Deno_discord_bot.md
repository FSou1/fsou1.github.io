Hello everybody. Today we will continue to use the [Deno](https://deno.land/) framework and develop a Discord bot. We'll also add some unit tests and see how to run them.

Since you may not be familiar with the approach, do not hesitate to post any comments/questions to this [video](https://youtu.be/1i3U-6gjGxw). Iâ€™m eager to receive your feedback.

I hope you enjoy this video.
