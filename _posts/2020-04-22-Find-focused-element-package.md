It's a short post about a new npm package I've just uploaded.

## TL;DR

* [Stackblitz - sample](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-uj2nvt)
* [GitHub - source code](https://github.com/FSou1/find-focused-element)
* [Npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/find-focused-element)

## Why

While developing a chrome extension I needed an easy way to access a currently focused element.

## Quick Start

Add it to your project:

```bash
npm install --save find-focused-element
```

Import using ES Modules:

```js
import findFocusedElem from 'find-focused-element';
```

Or as a CommonJS:

```js
const findFocusedElem = require('find-focused-element');
```

Use:

```js
const elem = findFocusedElem(window.document);
```

## Browser Support
The library has been tested in:
* Latest Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari (Mac)
* iOS 11 Safari
* IE 8-11
