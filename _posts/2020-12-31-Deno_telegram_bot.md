New Years Eve holidays is always a great chance to get into something new 🎄🎁

So in this video, we'll develop a basic telegram bot using [Deno](https://deno.land/) (a new secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript). In the process of developing, we'll also get into the platform's key features.

Since you may not be familiar with the approach, do not hesitate to post any comments/questions to this [video](https://youtu.be/buhTrROCvSk). I’m eager to receive your feedback.
