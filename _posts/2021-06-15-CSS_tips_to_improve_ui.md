Hi guys, great to see you again!

It's been a long time since my last video, and today I'm happy to finally share my new video (https://youtu.be/O8Jw_m9DdC4) with you.

The information here is not rocket science, but I wish there were more websites that follow these practices.

ðŸ’¬ If you find it valuable, let me know in the comments and I'll post another video on the same topic.

p.s. The "50 UI Tips" book is available here (https://www.producthunt.com/posts/50-ui-tips).
